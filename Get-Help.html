            <h1>What is domestic abuse?</h1>
Coercive Control
Domestic abuse isn’t always physical. Coercive control is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.
This controlling behaviour is designed to make a person dependent by isolating them from support, exploiting them, depriving them of independence and regulating their everyday behaviour.
Coercive control creates invisible chains and a sense of fear that pervades all elements of a victim’s life. It works to limit their human rights by depriving them of their liberty and reducing their ability for action. Experts like Evan Stark liken coercive control to being taken hostage. As he says: “the victim becomes captive in an unreal world created by the abuser, entrapped in a world of confusion, contradiction and fear.”
How do you know if this is happening to you?
Some common examples of coercive behaviour are:
•	Isolating you from friends and family
•	Depriving you of basic needs, such as food
•	Monitoring your time
•	Monitoring you via online communication tools or spyware
•	Taking control over aspects of your everyday life, such as where you can go, who you can see, what you can wear and when you can sleep
•	Depriving you access to support services, such as medical services
•	Repeatedly putting you down, such as saying you’re worthless
•	Humiliating, degrading or dehumanising you
•	Controlling your finances
•	Making threats or intimidating you
 
Gaslighting - Oh come on. I never said that.”
“You’re just being overly sensitive.”
“I don’t know why you’re making such a big deal out of this…”
Psychologists use the term “gaslighting” to refer to a specific type of manipulation where the manipulator is trying to get someone else (or a group of people) to question their own reality, memory or perceptions.  Gaslighting is experienced by women who are manipulated by their abuser into questioning and doubting their own sanity, perceptions and memory.

            <p style="text-align: left;">If anybody threatens, causes, or attempts to cause harm to you – it is a crime. This type of crime includes physical, mental, emotional and sexual abuse. These forms of abuse are used by abusers to control their partners and the relationship. The following are a list of tactics used by abusers:</p>


                <h3>Intimidation</h3> <p> Making you afraid by using looks, actions, gestures, smashing objects, destroying your property, abusing pets, displaying weapons.
                
<h3>Emotional Abuse</h3> <p>  Putting your down, making you feel bad about yourself, calling you names, making you think you are crazy, playing mind games, humiliating you.
                
<h3>Isolation</h3> <p> Controlling what you do, who you see and talk to, what you read, where you go, limiting your outside involvement, using jealousy to justify his/her actions.
                
                <h3>Minimising Denying and Blaming</h3> <p> Making light of the abuse and not taking your concerns seriously, saying the abuse did not happen, shifting responsibility for abusive behaviour, saying that you caused it.</p>
                
                <h3>Financial Abuse</h3> <p> Preventing you from getting or keeping a job, making you ask for money, giving you an allowance, taking your money, not letting your know about, or have access to income.</p>
                
                <h3>Manipulation</h3> <p> Making threats to do something to hurt you, your family or friends, treating to leave you, to commit suicide, to report you to Welfare, making you drop charges, making you do illegal things.</p>
